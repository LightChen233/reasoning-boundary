The magnetic field inside the tubes will remain constant due to the conservation of magnetic flux, but outside, the magnetic field will be changed. The magnetic field outside the straws is defined by the following condition: there is no circulation of $\\vec{B}$ (because there are no currents outside the straws); there are no sources of the field lines, other than the endpoints of the straws; each of the endpoints of the straws is a source of streamlines with a fixed magnetic flux $\\pm \\Phi$. These are exactly the same condition as those which define the electric field of four charges $\\pm Q$. We know that if the distance between charges is much larger than the geometrical size of a charge, the charges can be considered as point charges (the electric field near the charges remains almost constant, so that the respective contribution to the change of the overall electric field energy is negligible). Therefore we can conclude that the endpoints of the straws can be considered as magnetic point charges. In order to calculate the force between two magnetic charges (magnetic monopoles), we need to establish the correspondence between magnetic and electric quantities.\n\nFor two electric charges $Q$ separated by a distance $a$, the force is $F=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{2}}$, and at the position of one charge, the electric field of the other charge has energy density $w=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\varepsilon_{0}} \\frac{Q^{2}}{a^{4}}$; hence we can write $F=8 \\pi w a^{2}$. This is a universal expression for the force (for the case when the field lines have the same shape as in the case of two opposite and equal by modulus electric charges) relying only on the energy density, and not related to the nature of the field; so we can apply it to the magnetic\n\n\n\nfield. Indeed, the force can be calculated as a derivative of the full field energy with respect to a virtual displacement of a field line source (electric or magnetic charge); if the energy densities of two fields are respectively equal at one point, they are equal everywhere, and so are equal the full field energies. As it follows from the Gauss law, for a point source of a fixed magnetic flux $\\Phi$ at a distance $a$, the induction $B=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\Phi}{a^{2}}$. So, the energy density $w=\\frac{B^{2}}{2 \\mu_{0}}=\\frac{1}{32 \\pi^{2} \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{4}}$, hence\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\mu_{0}} \\frac{\\Phi^{2}}{a^{2}}\n$$\n\nFor the two straws, we have four magnetic charges.

CERN is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Its main goal is to get insight into the fundamental laws of nature. Two beams of particles are accelerated to high energies, guided around the accelerator ring by a strong magnetic field and then made to collide with each other. The protons are not spread uniformly around the circumference of the accelerator, but they are clustered in so-called bunches. The resulting particles generated by collisions are observed with large detectors. Some parameters of the LHC can be found in table 1 .\n\n| LHC ring |  |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Circumference of ring | $26659 \\mathrm{~m}$ |\n| Number of bunches per proton beam | 2808 |\n| Number of protons per bunch | $1.15 \\times 10^{11}$ |\n| Proton beams |  |\n| Energy of protons | $7.00 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n| Centre of mass energy | $14.0 \\mathrm{TeV}$ |\n\nTable 1: Typical numerical values of relevant LHC parameters.\n\nParticle physicists use convenient units for the energy, momentum and mass: The energy is measured in electron volts $[\\mathrm{eV}]$.

Since $1 \\mathrm{eV}$ is a very small quantity of energy, particle physicists often use $\\mathrm{MeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{MeV}=10^{6} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$, $\\mathrm{GeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{GeV}=10^{9} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$ or $\\mathrm{TeV}\\left(1 \\mathrm{TeV}=10^{12} \\mathrm{eV}\\right)$.\n\nPart A deals with the acceleration of protons or electrons.

Ballistics\n\nA ball, thrown with an initial speed $v_{0}$, moves in a homogeneous gravitational field in the $x-z$ plane, where the $x$-axis is horizontal, and the $z$-axis is vertical and antiparallel to the free fall acceleration $g$. Neglect the effect of air drag.\nContext question:\ni. By adjusting the launching angle for a ball thrown with a fixed initial speed $v_{0}$ from the origin, targets can be hit within the region given by\n\n$$\nz \\leq z_{0}-k x^{2}\n$$\n\nYou can use this fact without proving it. Find the constants $z_{0}$ and $k$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{ 2 g}$ , $\\frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}}$}\n\n\nContext question:\nii. The launching point can now be freely selected on the ground level $z=0$, and the launching angle can be adjusted as needed. The aim is to hit the topmost point of a spherical building of radius $R$ (see fig.) with the\n\n<img_4494>\nminimal initial speed $v_{0}$. Bouncing off the roof prior to hitting the target is not allowed. Sketch qualitatively the shape of the optimal trajectory of the ball (use the designated box on the answer sheet).

This would be described by a fourth order algebraic equation and therefore, it is not realistic to accomplish such a solution within a reasonable time frame.\n\nNote that the interior of the building needs to lie inside the region where the targets can be hit with a stone thrown from the top with initial speed $v_{\\min }$. Indeed, if we can throw over the building, we can hit anything inside by lowering the throwing angle. On the other hand, the boundary of the targetable region needs to touch the building. Indeed, if there were a gap, it would be possible to hit a target just above the point where the optimal trajectory touches the building; the trajectory through that target wouldn't touch the building anywhere, hence we arrive at a contradiction.\n\nSo, with $v_{0}$ corresponding to the optimal trajectory, the targetable region touches the building; due to symmetry, overall there are two touching points (for smaller speeds, there would be four, and for larger speeds, there would be none). With the origin at the top of the building, the intersection points are defined by the following system of equations:\n\n$$\nx^{2}+z^{2}+2 z R=0, \\quad z=\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{2 g}-\\frac{g x^{2}}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\n$$\n\nUpon eliminating $z$, this becomes a biquadratic equation for $x$ :\n\n$$\nx^{4}\\left(\\frac{g}{2 v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}+x^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{4 g}+R\\right) \\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{g}=0\n$$\n\nHence the speed by which the real-valued solutions disappear can be found from the condition that the discriminant vanishes:\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}\\right)^{2}=\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{g R}{v_{0}^{2}}=2\n$$\n\nBearing in mind that due to the energy conservation law, at the ground level the squared speed is increased by $4 g R$.

Simple model of an atomic nucleus \n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough atomic nuclei are quantum objects, a number of phenomenological laws for their basic properties (like radius or binding energy) can be deduced from simple assumptions: (i) nuclei are built from nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons); (ii) strong nuclear interaction holding these nucleons together has a very short range (it acts only between neighboring nucleons); (iii) the number of protons $(Z)$ in a given nucleus is approximately equal to the number of neutrons $(N)$, i.e. $Z \\approx N \\approx A / 2$, where $A$ is the total number of nucleons $(A \\gg 1)$. Important: Use these assumptions in Tasks 1-4 below.\n\nTask 1 - Atomic nucleus as closely packed system of nucleons\n\nIn a simple model, an atomic nucleus can be thought of as a ball consisting of closely packed nucleons [see Fig. 1(a)], where the nucleons are hard balls of radius $r_{N}=0.85 \\mathrm{fm}\\left(1 \\mathrm{fm}=10^{-15} \\mathrm{~m}\\right)$. The nuclear force is present only for two nucleons in contact. The volume of the nucleus $V$ is larger than the volume of all nucleons $A V_{N}$, where $V_{N}=\\frac{4}{3} r_{N}^{3} \\pi$. The ratio $f=A V_{N} / V$ is called the packing factor and gives the percentage of space filled by the nuclear matter.\n\n<img_4362>\nContext question:\na) Calculate what would be the packing factor $f$ if nucleons were arranged in a \"simple cubic\" (SC) crystal system, where each nucleon is centered on a lattice point of an infinite cubic lattice [see Fig. 1(b)].\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$\\frac{\\pi}{6}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nImportant: In all subsequent tasks, assume that the actual packing factor for nuclei is equal to the one from Task 1a. If you are not able to calculate it, in subsequent tasks use $f=1 / 2$.\nContext question:\nb) Estimate the average mass density $\\rho_{m}$, charge density $\\rho_{c}$, and the radius $R$ for a nucleus having $A$ nucleons.

In a nucleus, each proton is not acting upon itself (by Coulomb force), but only upon the rest of the protons.

For example, if a nucleus (with zero velocity) is in an excited state with energy $E_{\\text {exc }}$ above the ground state, its mass is $m=m_{0}+E_{e x c} / c^{2}$, where $m_{0}$ is its mass in the ground state at rest. The nuclear reaction ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}+{ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe} \\rightarrow{ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}+{ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is an example of the so-called \"transfer reactions\", in which a part of one nucleus (\"cluster\") is transferred to the other (see Fig. 3). In our example the transferred part is a ${ }^{4} \\mathrm{He}-\\mathrm{cluster}(\\alpha$-particle). The transfer reactions occur with maximum probability if the velocity of the projectile-like reaction product (in our case: ${ }^{12} \\mathrm{C}$ ) is equal both in magnitude and direction to the velocity of projectile (in our case: ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ ). The target ${ }^{54} \\mathrm{Fe}$ is initially at rest. In the reaction, ${ }^{58} \\mathrm{Ni}$ is excited into one of its higher-lying states. Find the excitation energy of that state (and express it units of $\\mathrm{MeV}$ ) if the kinetic energy of the projectile ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{O}$ is $50 \\mathrm{MeV}$.

The key intuition here is that the magnitude of the fluid velocity above the cylinder will be higher on the top because the tangential velocity of the cylinder is in the same direction as the velocity of the fluid on the top. By Bernoulli's principle, this means that the pressure on the top is lower than the pressure on the bottom, which will create a lift force on the cylinder.\nWith the given theory, we can model this quantitatively.

The rod is initially in unstable equilibrium, and as it falls, it will rotate about the point where the thread is attached.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to understand the dynamics of the system and the forces acting on the rod. The tension in the thread will vary as the rod falls, and we are interested in finding the minimum tension during the entire motion.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Conditions**: The rod is initially upside down, with its center of mass directly below the point of suspension. The gravitational force acts downward on the center of mass.\n\n2. **Motion Analysis**: As the rod falls, it will rotate about the point of suspension. The center of mass will move in a circular arc, and the rod will experience both translational and rotational motion.\n\n3. **Forces Acting on the Rod**: The forces acting on the rod are the tension in the thread and the gravitational force. The tension provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion of the center of mass.\n\n4. **Minimum Tension**: The minimum tension occurs when the rod is in the horizontal position during its fall. At this point, the gravitational force is entirely responsible for the centripetal acceleration of the center of mass.\n\n5. **Calculation of Minimum Tension**: When the rod is horizontal, the tension in the thread is at its minimum.

However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed.

Here's how we can approach the problem:\n\n1. **Reflective Planet and Polarization**: The planet is a perfect polarizer, meaning it reflects light with a certain polarization. The laser hits the planet at a distance of \\( \\frac{R_p}{2} \\) from the line connecting Darth Vader to the center of the planet. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the light is plane polarized upon reflection.\n\n2. **Energy Transfer**: Since the planet is purely reflective, it does not absorb any energy from the laser. The entire power of the laser is reflected towards the moon.\n\n3. **Moon as a Blackbody**: The moon absorbs all the incident light perfectly, as it is modeled as a blackbody.\n\n4. **Calculating Energy Absorbed**: The energy absorbed by the moon is equal to the power of the laser multiplied by the time the laser is on. Since the problem states that the laser is locked on until the planet moves right in front of Darth Vader, we need to calculate the time it takes for the moon to move from its initial position to directly in front of Darth Vader.\n\n5. **Orbital Dynamics**: Assuming the moon orbits the planet in a circular path, we can calculate the orbital period and determine the time it takes for the moon to move to the specified position.\n\nLet's write the code to calculate the energy absorbed by the moon:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solver():\n    # Constants\n    R_p = 40000  # radius of the planet in meters\n    M_p = 8.128e24  # mass of the planet in kg\n    R_s = 6400000  # orbital radius of the moon in meters\n    M_s = 9.346e19  # mass of the moon in kg\n    P_0 = 2e32  # power of the laser in watts\n    \n    # Gravitational constant\n    G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2\n    \n    # Calculate the orbital period of the moon\n    T = 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(R_s**3 / (G * M_p))\n    \n    # Calculate the time the laser is on (half the orbital period)\n    time_on = T / 2\n    \n    # Calculate the energy absorbed by the moon\n    energy_absorbed = P_0 * time_on\n    \n    return energy_absorbed\n\n```\n\nThis code calculates the energy absorbed by the moon by first determining the orbital period of the moon around the planet using Kepler's third law, and then calculating the time the laser is on (half the orbital period). Finally, it multiplies the laser power by the time to find the total energy absorbed."}]}], "origin": {"id": "olympaid-Modern Physics-820", "image_id": "olympaid-Modern Physics-820", "question": "While exploring outer space, Darth Vader comes upon a purely reflective spherical planet with radius $R_{p}=$ $40,000 \\mathrm{~m}$ and mass $M_{p}=8.128 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}$.

Since moments of inertia simply add about a given axis, we can calculate the moments of inertia of the three \"sectors\" whose union forms the given area and subtract twice the moment of inertia of the triangle, so our answer will be $3 I_{s, O}-2 I_{t, O}$.\nClaim: The center of mass of a sector is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the vertex of the sector along its axis of symmetry. Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$. Then, the $x$-coordinate of a point on the arc whose corresponding radius makes an angle of $\\theta$ with the axis of symmetry is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta)$. We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)-\\sin \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n\nThis concludes the proof.\n\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\n\n$$\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n. It's well known that $I_{s, X}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\n\n$$\nI_{s, M}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\pi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\n\n$$\nI_{t, O}=\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle.

The key is to find the angle $\\theta$ at which the mass, when released, will move in such a way that it comes close enough to Bob for him to catch it.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Centripetal Force and Spring Force:**\n   - The spaceship is rotating to simulate gravitational acceleration $g$. Therefore, the centripetal force required to keep the mass at rest at point $A$ is $m \\cdot g = m \\cdot \\omega^2 \\cdot R$.\n   - When the mass is released from point $O$, the only force acting on it is the spring force. The spring force will provide the necessary centripetal force to keep the mass moving in a circular path.\n\n2. **Spring Force Dynamics:**\n   - The spring force $F_s$ is given by Hooke's Law: $F_s = k \\cdot x$, where $k$ is the spring constant and $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position.\n   - At the point of release, the spring is stretched by a distance $R$ (the radius of the spaceship).\n\n3. **Motion of the Mass:**\n   - The mass will oscillate back and forth due to the spring force. The angular frequency of this oscillation is given by $\\omega_s = \\sqrt{k/m}$.\n   - The mass will move in a circular path due to the rotation of the spaceship.\n\n4. **Finding the Angle $\\theta$:**\n   - For the mass to come close enough to Bob, it must reach point $B$ when Bob is there.\n   - The time it takes for the mass to reach point $B$ is determined by the oscillation period of the spring-mass system.\n   - The angle $\\theta$ is related to the time it takes for Bob to move from point $A$ to point $B$.\n\n5. **Calculating $\\theta$:**\n   - The time period of the spring-mass system is $T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{m/k}$.\n   - Bob moves with angular velocity $\\omega$. The time for Bob to move an angle $\\theta$ is $t = \\theta / \\omega$.\n   - For the mass to reach Bob, $t$ should be a multiple of the half-period of the oscillation, i.e., $t = n \\cdot T/2$ for some integer $n$.\n\n6. **Final Calculation:**\n   - Set $\\theta / \\omega = n \\cdot \\pi \\sqrt{m/k}$.\n   - Solve for $\\theta$: $\\theta = n \\cdot \\pi \\omega \\sqrt{m/k}$.\n   - Choose the smallest $n$ such that $\\theta$ is less than $360^\\circ$.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, let's assume some reasonable values for $m$, $k$, and $\\omega$ to find a numerical solution for $\\theta$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solver():\n    # Constants (assuming reasonable values for demonstration)\n    m = 1.0  # mass in kg\n    k = 10.0  # spring constant in N/m\n    omega = 1.0  # angular velocity in rad/s\n    \n    # Calculate the angular frequency of the spring-mass system\n    omega_s = math.sqrt(k / m)\n    \n    # Calculate the time period of the spring-mass system\n    T = 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(m / k)\n    \n    # Calculate theta for the smallest n\n    n = 1\n    theta = n * math.pi * omega * math.sqrt(m / k)\n    \n    # Convert theta from radians to degrees\n    theta_degrees = math.degrees(theta)\n    \n    # Ensure theta is less than 360 degrees\n    while theta_degrees >= 360:\n        n += 1\n        theta = n * math.pi * omega * math.sqrt(m / k)\n        theta_degrees = math.degrees(theta)\n    \n    # Round to the nearest tenth of a degree\n    theta_degrees = round(theta_degrees, 1)\n    \n    return theta_degrees\n\nsolver()\n```\n\nThis code calculates the angle $\\theta$ to the nearest tenth of a degree, given the assumptions and simplifications made."}]}], "origin": {"id": "olympaid-Mechanics-839", "image_id": "olympaid-Mechanics-839", "question": "Two astronauts, Alice and Bob, are standing inside their cylindrical spaceship, which is rotating at an angular velocity $\\omega$ clockwise around its axis in order to simulate the gravitational acceleration $g$ on earth.

The $n^{\\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. For all $n$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $k<0$ or $k>n$. We write the nonzero values of $\\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.\n\n<image_1>\n\nAs is well known, $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.\nIf $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, n)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+1, n)+\\cdots+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k, n)=\\mathrm{Pa}(m, j)$, find and justify formulas for $m$ and $j$ in terms of $n$ and $k$.", "context": "", "answer": "$m=n+k+1$, $j=n+1$", "rationale": "Notice that $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, n)+\\operatorname{Pa}(n+1, n)+\\cdots+\\operatorname{Pa}(n+k, n)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n+1)$, so $m=n+k+1$ and $j=n+1$. (By symmetry, $j=k$ is also correct.) The equation is true for all $n$ when $k=0$, because the sum is simply $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, n)$ and the right side is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+1, n+1)$, both of which are 1 . Proceed by induction on $k$. If $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, n)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+1, n)+\\cdots+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k, n)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n+1)$, then adding $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n)$ to both sides yields $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n+1)=$ $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+2, n+1)$ by the recursive rule for $\\mathrm{Pa}$.", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "Combinatorics", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Combinatorics-3051.png", "global_bound": 1, "local_bound": 56, "index": "124"}}

The set of vertices can be split into two rings:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}=\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the inner ring), } \\quad \\mathcal{O}=\\left\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the outer ring). }\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}=A$. The two rings are connected by the edges $E=\\left\\{A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6} B_{6}\\right\\}$. Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose those two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nThe forced path is a loop, and the only way the given conditions are satisfied if $A_{i+k}=A_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+k}=B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use (precisely) two consecutive edges from $E: A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nEach undirected loop can be traced in two ways, and thus the number of ways for Xena to trace the path is $(6+2) \\cdot 2=16$.", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "geometry", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Geometry-2769.png", "global_bound": 8, "local_bound": 28, "index": "110"}}

Using this vocabulary, the problem's condition is that every pair of neighbors must be friends of each other. Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below. For each cycle, there are 8 rotations. Thus there are 16 possible configurations with no number written in the center square.\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | - | 5 |\n| 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\n\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 5 | - | 4 |\n| 7 | 8 | 6 |\n\nNow assume that the center square contains the number $n$. Because $n$ has at least three neighbors, $n \\neq 1$ and $n \\neq 8$. First we show that 1 must be in a corner. If 1 is a neighbor of $n$, then one of the corners neighboring 1 must be empty, because 1 has only two friends ( 2 and $3)$. If $c$ is in the other corner neighboring 1 , then $\\{n, c\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. But then $n$ must have three\n\n\n\nmore friends $\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\right)$ other than 1 and $c$, for a total of five friends, which is impossible, as illustrated below.

If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$. Consequently, $m_{1}=5$ (refer to the figure below). Then 4 has one friend (namely 6) left with two neighbors $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, which is impossible. Thus 1 must have exactly one neighbor. An analogous argument shows that 8 must also be at a corner with exactly one neighbor.\n\n| 1 | 2 | - |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3 | $n$ | $m_{3}$ |\n| $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ |  |\n\nTherefore, 8 and 1 must be in non-opposite corners, with the blank square between them. Thus, up to reflections and rotations, the only possible configuration is the one shown at left below.\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $m$ |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $2 / 3$ | $4 / 5$ | $6 / 7$ |\n| $3 / 2$ | $5 / 4$ | $7 / 6$ |\n\nThere are two possible values for $m$, namely 2 and 3 . For each of the cases $m=2$ and $m=3$, the rest of the configuration is uniquely determined, as illustrated in the figure above right.

This leads to $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=16$ distinct configurations with a number written in the center square.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 configurations in which the center square is blank and 16 configurations with a number in the center square, for a total of $\\mathbf{3 2}$ distinct configurations.", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "Combinatorics", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Combinatorics-2889.png", "global_bound": 14, "local_bound": 16, "index": "118"}}

This curve is resemblant of a quadratic in the form of $y=k_{1} x^{2}$ and upon solving for $k_{1}$ we find that the curve is given as $P=20 v^{2}$. Secondly, the next line remains constant with respect to time as a line $P=900$.

To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 . Such a pyramid has slant height $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and height $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1^{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}$. Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$. Then $P Q=R_{C}-R_{I}$, where $R_{C}$ is the circumradius and $R_{I}$ the inradius of the equilateral triangle. Thus $P Q=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Then $B P^{2}=P Q^{2}+B Q^{2}=\\frac{3}{36}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $A P^{2}=A B^{2}-B P^{2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and $A P=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow let a vertical stretch take place along an axis parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{A P}$. If the scale factor is $r$, then $A P=\\frac{r \\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and because the stretch occurs on an axis perpendicular to $\\overline{B P}$, the length $B P$ is unchanged, as can be seen below.\n\n<img_3791>\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6 r^{2}}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{6 r^{2}+3}{9}$. It remains to compute $r$.

Similarly, the tangents from $D$ to the circle ($DS$ and $DT$) are equal.\n\nDue to the symmetry and equal angles, the quadrilateral can be divided into four equal sections, each forming a right triangle with the circle's radius as one leg and the tangent as the other leg.\n\nTherefore, the length of $DS$ is equal to the length of the tangent from $A$, which is $AO - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n\nThus, the length of $DS$ is 2.\n\n```\ndef solver():\n    AO = 3\n    radius = 1\n    DS = AO - radius\n    return DS\n```"}]}], "origin": {"id": "olympaid-Geometry-2550", "image_id": "olympaid-Geometry-2550", "question": "A circle has centre $O$ and radius 1.

Suppose that its angle with the horizontal is $\\alpha$. (In the diagram, $\\alpha<90^{\\circ}$.) We assume that the topping is added on the half pizza clockwise beginning at the angle of $\\alpha$, and that this topping stays in the same relative position as the diameter sweeps around the circle.\n\nFor what angles $\\alpha$ will there be a portion of the pizza covered with all three toppings?\n\nIf $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}$, there will be a portion covered with three toppings; this portion is above the right half of the horizontal diameter.\n\nIf $180^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}+\\theta$, the third diameter will pass through the two regions with angle $\\theta$ and the third topping will be below this diameter, so there will not be a region covered\n\n\n\nwith three toppings.\n\nIf $180^{\\circ}+\\theta \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$, the third topping starts to cover the leftmost part of the region currently covered with two toppings, and so a region is covered with three toppings.\n\nTherefore, for an angle $\\theta$ with $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 180^{\\circ}$, a region of the pizza is covered with three toppings when $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}$ and when $180^{\\circ}+\\theta \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo determine the desired probability, we graph points $(\\theta, \\alpha)$. A particular choice of diameters corresponds to a choice of angles $\\theta$ and $\\alpha$ with $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 180^{\\circ}$ and $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$, which corresponds to a point on the graph below.\n\nThe probability that we are looking for then equals the area of the region of this graph where three toppings are in a portion of the pizza divided by the total allowable area of the graph.\n\nThe shaded region of the graph corresponds to instances where a portion of the pizza will be covered by three toppings.\n\n<img_3744>\n\nThis shaded region consists of the entire portion of the graph where $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 180^{\\circ}$ (regardless of $\\theta$ ) as well as the region above the line with equation $\\alpha=\\theta+180^{\\circ}$ (that is, the region with $\\theta+180^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$ ).\n\nSince the slope of the line is 1 , it divides the upper half of the region, which is a square, into two pieces of equal area.\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the graph is shaded, which means that the probability that a region of the pizza is covered by all three toppings is $\\frac{3}{4}$.", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "Combinatorics", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Combinatorics-2518.png", "global_bound": 17, "local_bound": 23, "index": "85"}}

Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 .", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "algebra", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Algebra-2543.png", "global_bound": 56, "local_bound": 90, "index": "93"}}

A triangle is acute if all its angles are less than \\(90^\\circ\\). For a triangle inscribed in a circle, this means that the arc opposite each angle must be less than a semicircle (i.e., less than \\(180^\\circ\\)).\n\nFor \\(N = 7\\), the circle is divided into 7 equal arcs of \\(\\frac{360^\\circ}{7} \\approx 51.43^\\circ\\).

Join $R$ to $N$ and $B$.\n\n<img_3945>\n\nSo the volume of solid $A B C D P M N$ equals the volume of solid $A B C D P Q R N$ minus the volumes of solids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$.\n\nSolid $A B C D P Q R N$ is a trapezoidal prism. This is because $N R$ and $B C$ are parallel (since they lie in parallel planes), which makes $N R B C$ a trapezoid. Similarly, $P Q A D$ is a trapezoid. Also, $P N, Q R, D C$, and $A B$ are all perpendicular to the planes of these trapezoids and equal in length, since they equal the side lengths of the squares.\n\nSolids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$ are triangular-based pyramids. We can think of their bases as being $\\triangle P M Q$ and $\\triangle N M R$. Their heights are each equal to 2 , the height of the original solid. (The volume of a triangular-based pyramid equals $\\frac{1}{3}$ times the area of its base times its height.)\n\nThe volume of $A B C D P Q R N$ equals the area of trapezoid $N R B C$ times the width of the prism, which is 2.\n\nThat is, this volume equals $\\frac{1}{2}(N R+B C)(N C)(N P)=\\frac{1}{2}(N R+2)(2)(2)=2 \\cdot N R+4$.\n\nSo we need to find the length of $N R$.\n\nConsider quadrilateral $P N R Q$. This quadrilateral is a rectangle since $P N$ and $Q R$ are perpendicular to the two side planes of the original solid.\n\nThus, $N R$ equals the height of $\\triangle P M N$.\n\nJoin $M$ to the midpoint $T$ of $P N$.\n\nSince $\\triangle P M N$ is isosceles, then $M T$ is perpendicular to $P N$.\n\n<img_3305>\n\nSince $N T=\\frac{1}{2} P N=1$ and $\\angle P M N=90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle T N M=45^{\\circ}$, then $\\triangle M T N$ is also right-angled and isosceles with $M T=T N=1$.\n\nTherefore, $N R=M T=1$ and so the volume of $A B C D P Q R N$ is $2 \\cdot 1+4=6$.\n\nThe volumes of solids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$ are equal. Each has height 2 and their bases $\\triangle P M Q$ and $\\triangle N M R$ are congruent, because each is right-angled (at $Q$ and at $R$ ) with $P Q=N R=1$ and $Q M=M R=1$.\n\nThus, using the formula above, the volume of each is $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)\\right) 2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the original solid equals $6-2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$.", "split": "test", "domain": "olympaid", "topic": "geometry", "image_path": "data/olympiadbench/images/olympaid-Geometry-2429.png", "global_bound": 19, "local_bound": 15, "index": "60"}}

When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even.

Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument.
