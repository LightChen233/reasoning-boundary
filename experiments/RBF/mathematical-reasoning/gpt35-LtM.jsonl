If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nAnswer: Let's break down this problem:\n1. What is Tina's hourly wage?\nTina's hourly wage is $18.\n2. How is Tina's overtime pay rate calculated?\nFor overtime, Tina is paid her hourly wage plus 1/2 of her hourly wage. So her overtime pay rate is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.\n3. How is Tina's regular pay?\nTina is paid 8 hours/day x $18/hour x 5 days = $720.\n4. How is Tina's overtime pay?\nTina is paid 2 hours/day x $27/hour x 5 days = $270.\n6.

How long did it take Leo to finish the first part of the assignment?\nThe first part of the assignment was completed in 25 minutes.\n3. How long did it take Leo to finish the second part of the assignment?\nThe time to complete the second part was 2 x 25 minutes = 50 minutes.\n4. How long did it take Leo to finish the entire assignment?\nLeo was able to finish his assignment in 2 hours, which is 120 minutes.\n5. How many minutes did Leo take to finish the third part of the assignment?\nLeo finished the third part of the assignment in 120 minutes - 25 minutes - 50 minutes = 45 minutes\n6.

If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nAnswer: Let's break down this problem:\n1. What is Tina's hourly wage?\nTina's hourly wage is $18.\n2. How is Tina's overtime pay rate calculated?\nFor overtime, Tina is paid her hourly wage plus 1/2 of her hourly wage. So her overtime pay rate is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.\n3. How is Tina's regular pay?\nTina is paid 8 hours/day x $18/hour x 5 days = $720.\n4. How is Tina's overtime pay?\nTina is paid 2 hours/day x $27/hour x 5 days = $270.\n6.

If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nAnswer: Let's break down this problem:\n1. What is Tina's hourly wage?\nTina's hourly wage is $18.\n2. How is Tina's overtime pay rate calculated?\nFor overtime, Tina is paid her hourly wage plus 1/2 of her hourly wage. So her overtime pay rate is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.\n3. How is Tina's regular pay?\nTina is paid 8 hours/day x $18/hour x 5 days = $720.\n4. How is Tina's overtime pay?\nTina is paid 2 hours/day x $27/hour x 5 days = $270.\n6.

How is Tina's overtime pay rate calculated?\nFor overtime, Tina is paid her hourly wage plus 1/2 of her hourly wage. So her overtime pay rate is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.\n3. How is Tina's regular pay?\nTina is paid 8 hours/day x $18/hour x 5 days = $720.\n4. How is Tina's overtime pay?\nTina is paid 2 hours/day x $27/hour x 5 days = $270.\n6.

If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?\nAnswer: Let's break down this problem:\n1. What is Tina's hourly wage?\nTina's hourly wage is $18.\n2. How is Tina's overtime pay rate calculated?\nFor overtime, Tina is paid her hourly wage plus 1/2 of her hourly wage. So her overtime pay rate is $18 + ($18 / 2) = $18 + $9 = $27 per hour.\n3. How is Tina's regular pay?\nTina is paid 8 hours/day x $18/hour x 5 days = $720.\n4. How is Tina's overtime pay?\nTina is paid 2 hours/day x $27/hour x 5 days = $270.\n6.
